# Trixie (glibc 2.41), not bookworm (2.36): better-sqlite3 ships an arm64 prebuild
# linked against GLIBC_2.38, so on bookworm it loads and then dies at runtime with
# "version `GLIBC_2.38' not found" the first time a tab is opened. amd64 is
# unaffected because that prebuild targets an older glibc.
